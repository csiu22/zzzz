zzzz
====

Our website, "zzzz," is designed to help people with insomnia. Insomnia can be defined as having trouble falling or staying asleep. The user class that we are targeting are people who suffer from anxiety and people with poor sleep habits. The first class can’t sleep because they are thinking worrisome or random thoughts and they have trouble just “shutting off” their brain. The latter class can’t sleep because they have an irregular sleep schedule. We hope this website will help users be distracted from their anxious thoughts and also establish a nightly routine for themselves.
